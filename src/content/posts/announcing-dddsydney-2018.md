That's right folks, DDD Sydney is back for 2018!

Over the last two years we've been quite successful, at least in our opinion, on our goal of creating a great, accessible conference for developers. You can check out the [2016](http://2016.dddsydney.com.au) and [2017](http://2017.dddsydney.com.au) content on our website.

Our brand has long been associated with the raw enthusiasm of Steve Balmer. Laden in sweat during one of his renowned keynotes, he repeated [Developers, Developers, Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VgVJpVx9bc) over and over to emphasise their importance to Windows. While this might have been the case in 2000, as we launch for 2018, we're seeking to bring together the communities that build the software of tomorrow. No longer do developers stand alone - and so we welcome design and data science content to our DDD conference this year.

If you know designers and data scientists, spread the word to them, encourage them to submit talks and attend on the day.

We look forward to your talks and to see you on the 18th of August!
