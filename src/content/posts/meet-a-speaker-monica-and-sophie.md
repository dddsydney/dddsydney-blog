Not long now until DDD Sydney 2018 and in the lead up we wanted to make sure you get to know our speakers. Today we wanted to introduce you to not one but two speakers, Monical Ella Regalado and Sophie Gardner, who are co-presenting at DDD Sydney!

**DDD**: What excites you most about being a speaker at DDD Sydney?

**Monica**: I’m excited to make friends and meet other people who are passionate about tech and design. It will be super awesome to be in an environment where everyone can share their knowledge and experience.

**Sophie**: The chance to connect with new devs, UX, data scientists and researchers across Sydney. It’s rare that we have all these disciplines in the same room together.
 
**DDD**: How did you get into speaking?

**Monica**: Sophie and I spend hours talking about design with each other and with other people in the industry, and we learn so much just by doing this. Doing talks or listening to them is a great way to see other ways of thinking.
 
**Sophie**: We went to a lot of talks when we first started out and it really helped to hear other peoples’ experiences. I think we all benefit from when we share our experiences and we grow as a community.
 
**DDD**: What should people expect in your talk?

**Sophie**:

* Approaches to working effectively in interdisciplinary environwmts with real examples of what has and hasn't worked in the past 
* Insight into how this is achieved at large engineering companies, agencies and start ups 
* Stories of failures and successes 

**DDD**: What talks, other than your own, are you looking forward to seeing?

**Sophie**: There are so many to pick from! Machine Learning with CoreML & Azure Cognitive Services sounds like it will help people to practically integrate machine learning into work.
 
**Monica**: If I had to pick one… Casper Yuill’s talk on How we know what we know: Using philosophy and ethnography to define the limits of AI sounds like it will be super insightful because I love the intersection of culture, people, and technology.
 
**DDD**: Anything else you want to say to people thinking of coming to DDD Sydney

**Monica**: This is my first DDD event but I know it’s going to be awesome! The organisers have put a lot of effort into making it accessible, as well as curating a variety of talks that you will be able to learn so much from! It is really great that everyone gets to contribute to such an event (and really great to have supportive and hardworking organisers behind it).
 
**Sophie**: This is one of the few highly interdisciplinary spaces in Sydney right now, it's definitely somewhere you want to be if your interested in how these intersections intertwine.
