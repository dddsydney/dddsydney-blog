Last week we held our first DDD By Night event, continuing on the trend of first from last years DDD Sydney (first Junior Dev track, first Data & Design track, first time selling out) and it was a hugh success, if I do say so myself! ðŸ˜‰

We started the night with a bit of networking and, of course, food!

We decided to not go down the traditional pizza route and instead get something a little different from [Cuon](https://twitter.com/cuoncatering), a mix of different Vietnamese food. We were pretty chuffed with the food and canvasing the room it seemed like everyone enjoyed it and appreciated the change from the usual meetup-style food.

We got underway with the big announcement, DDD Sydney 2019 will be on the **21st September** at our usual home, UTS!

[Charlie](https://twitter.com/devdevcharlie) got us underway with a dive into wearables and conductive textiles, which was a crazy amount to get through in 15 minutes!

[Georgie](https://twitter.com/georgiecel) then gave us a bunch of tips and tricks on how to improve the accessibility of our web applications, something that everyone should be thinking about.

[Sam](https://twitter.com/BugHunterSam) gave us the most, err, insightful talk of the night, talking about her idea for a poo tracking application! ðŸ¤£
