Recently we announced that we'll be running a [CFP workshop]({{< ref "posts/cfp-workshop.md" >}}) but through an error in judgement we organised it to be on the afternoon of mothers day!

As an event that strives to be inclusive for everyone this is something that we need to rectify, so we've shifted the workshop by a week to the **20th of May**.

Apologies for any inconvenience or confusion that this has caused people, but hopefully we'll see you on the 20th of May!
